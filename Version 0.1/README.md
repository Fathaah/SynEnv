# Synthetic Data Generator from 3D Model old version(Work In Progress)

This is an old reference version of the code, this was created in 2017 and requires lot of polishing. The files in this directory were uused for the following tasks:

* Generation of a depth dataset, the program was capable of generating a synthetic scene by randomly spawning objects then the view is used to generate the depth map from the distace from camera.

* Hand pose detection, a random hand pose in varying orientation was generated and keypoints were determined and stored in a file.
